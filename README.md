# HouseClock - A GPS Network Time Server with Web console

A project to create a simple stratum 1 NTP server based on a local GPS time source (NMEA only).

The main goal is to setup a local time server that is independent of the state of the Internet link. The server status is available through a web interface. Security is not a goal in the short run, but is planned based on HTTPS and access keys.
